1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This EPP mapping
   enables a client to get their financial information including the
   balance, credit limit, available credit, and credit threshold.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and

   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this protocol.

   "balance-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "http://www.verisign.com/epp/balance-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "balance" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.

2.  Object Attributes

2.1.  Decimal Attribute Values

   All of the EPP Balance currency object attributes use the XML decimal
   [1] data type to represent the currency value in the currency of the
   server.  The precision is restricted to 2 fractional digits.

2.2.  Dates and Times

   Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in XML
   Schema Part 2 [2] MUST be used to represent date-time values, as XML
   Schema does not support truncated date-time forms or lower case "T"
   and "Z" characters.

3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use with the Balance
   object mapping.

3.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP [RFC5730] provides three commands to retrieve object information:
   <check> to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to
   retrieve detailed information associated with an object, and
   <transfer> to retrieve object transfer status information.

3.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   Available check semantics do not apply to balance objects, so there
   is no mapping defined for the EPP <check> command.

3.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   EPP provides the <info> command that is used to retrieve client
   balance and other financial information.  In addition to the standard
   EPP command elements, the <info> command MUST contain a
   <balance:info> element that identifies the balance namespace.  The
   <balance:info> element does not contain any child elements.

   Example <info> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <info>
   C:      <balance:info
   C:        xmlns:balance="http://www.verisign.com/epp/balance-1.0"/>
   C:    </info>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child <balance:infData> element that
   identifies the balance namespace.  The <balance:infData> element
   contains the following child elements:

   <balance:creditLimit>  element that contains the credit limit in the
       currency of the server.
   <balance:balance>  element that contains the balance in the currency
       of the server.
   <balance:availableCredit>  element that contains the available credit
       in the currency of the server.
   <balance:creditThreshold>  element that contains the low available
       credit threshold to receive a low balance notification message
       based on the Low Balance EPP Mapping.  The
       <balance:creditThreshold> element contains one of the following
       child elements:


       <balance:fixed>  element that contains a fixed amount low credit
           threshold in the currency of the server.
       <balance:percent>  element that contains an integer percent value
           low credit threshold that represents a percentage of the
           <balance:creditLimit> value.  The low credit threshold is
           calculated by multiplying the <balance:creditLimit> value
           with the <balance:percent> percentage value.

3.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Command

   Transfer semantics do not apply to balance objects, so there is no
   mapping defined for the EPP <transfer> command.

3.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.

3.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   Create semantics do not apply to balance objects, so there is no
   mapping defined for the EPP <create> command.

3.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   Delete semantics do not apply to balance objects, so there is no
   mapping defined for the EPP <delete> command.

3.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   Renew semantics do not apply to balance objects, so there is no
   mapping defined for the EPP <renew> command.

3.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   Transfer semantics do not apply to balance objects, so there is no
   mapping defined for the EPP <transfer> command.

3.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   Update semantics do not apply to balance objects, so there is no
   mapping defined for the EPP <update> command.

4.  Formal Syntax

   One schema is presented here that is the EPP Balance schema.

   The formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   of the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.
