1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This EPP extension
   supports the poll message created by the server when a restore report
   has not been submitted for a restore request in the Domain Registry
   Grace Period (RGP) Mapping [RFC3915].

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this protocol.

   "rgp-poll-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "http://www.verisign.com/epp/rgp-poll-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix

                                rgp-poll                   December 2013


   "rgp-poll" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.

2.  Object Attributes

   The EPP RGP Poll has attributes and associated values that may be
   viewed by the sponsoring client or server.  This section describes
   each attribute type in detail.

2.1.  Language Tag

   The RGP status attribute includes the non-grace period statuses
   defined in the Domain Registry Grace Period (RGP) Mapping [RFC3915].
   Specifically, the redemptionPeriod, pendingRestore, and pendingDelete
   statuses MUST be used.

2.2.  Dates and Times

   Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in XML
   Schema Part 2 [1] MUST be used to represent date-time values, as XML
   Schema does not support truncated date-time forms or lower case "T"
   and "Z" characters.

3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mapping described here is specifically for use with the Domain
   Registry Grace Period (RGP) Mapping [RFC3915].

3.1.  EPP <poll> Command

   The EPP <poll> command and response is defined in section 2.9.2.3 of
   [RFC5730].  The RGP Poll Notification is included in the EPP <poll>
   response of [RFC5730].

   For the RGP Poll Notification, poll messages apply whenever an
   [RFC3915] RGP restore request command is successfully completed and
   the RGP restore report command has not been received.  The RGP Poll
   message includes the domain name, the restore request date, the
   restore report due date, and the current RGP status of the domain as
   defined in section 3.1 of [RFC3915].  In the case of a RGP specific
   message, a <rgp-poll:pollData> element will be included within the
   <resData> element of the standard <poll> response.  The <rgp-
   poll:pollData> element will include a reference to the rgp-poll

   namespace.  EPP data contained within the <rgp-poll:pollData> element
   is formatted according to the rgp-poll schema.

   Example <poll> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:  <poll op="req"/>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>

   An RGP Poll Message consists of the <rgp-poll:pollData> element with
   the following child elements:

   <rgp-poll:name>  The domain name that is a candidate for restoration.
   <rgp-poll:rgpStatus>  The RGP status, using the "s" attribute value
       of the element, of the domain name as defined in [RFC3915],
       exclusive of the grace period statuses.
   <rgp-poll:reqDate>  The date and time the server received the restore
       request.
   <rgp-poll:reportDueDate>  The date and time the restore report MUST
       be received by the server to restore the domain name.

   Example <poll> response with the RGP Poll Message:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1301">
   S:      <msg>Command completed successfully; ack to dequeue</msg>
   S:    </result>
   S:    <msgQ count="5" id="12345">
   S:      <qDate>2013-05-03T20:06:17.0002Z</qDate>
   S:      <msg>Restore Request Pending</msg>
   S:    </msgQ>
   S:    <resData>
   S:      <rgp-poll:pollData
   S:        xmlns:rgp-poll="http://www.verisign.com/epp/rgp-poll-1.0">
   S:        <rgp-poll:name>foobar.com</rgp-poll:name>
   S:        <rgp-poll:rgpStatus s="pendingDelete"/>
   S:        <rgp-poll:reqDate>2013-05-03T20:06:17.0002Z
   S:        </rgp-poll:reqDate>
   S:        <rgp-poll:reportDueDate>2013-05-08T20:06:17.0002Z
   S:        </rgp-poll:reportDueDate>
   S:      </rgp-poll:pollData>
   S:    </resData>
   S:    <trID>
   S:      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   S:      <svTRID>54322-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:    </trID>
   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

4.  Formal Syntax

   One schema is presented here that is the RGP Poll Mapping schema.

   The formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   of the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.
